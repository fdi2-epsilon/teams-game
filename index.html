    <h2>The lamest project ever</h2>

    <p>
      Enigma is a simple quiz application for Android and
      <del>PCs</del>
      .
      Collections of quizzes are loaded from <code>eqc</code> files. <b>TODO: SO?</b>
    </p>

  <div class="slide">

    <h2>Quiz collections with "powerful" templating library</h2>

    <p>
      Templates are a way to separate quiz content from its view representation:
      A <code>document.xml</code> just like <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/fdi2-epsilon/teams-game/blob/master/levels/starTrek/src/eqc/01.%20Lo%20sbarco/document.xml">this</a> is parsed by a template processor and
      transformed in
      <del>awesome</del>
      HTML pages, ready to be displayed to the user.

      The best part is that you can also define your own template processors using the template API in Java, package
      them together
      with your quizzes and use them at runtime.

    <h2>Compelling stories 4 everyone!</h2>
    Luca D. took care to write some user stories as issues on GitHub.
    Then I made a simple Scala app, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fdi2-epsilon/journal">Journal</a>, to filter the story issues and format them to HTML... and everyone lost their mind. Here's the output:

    <object width="800" height="400" data="oth/report-output/user-stories.html"></object>

    Pff... I have just noticed that these are not in english...

    <h2>But Marco had his problems...</h2>
    Our teammate Marco had to face some personal problems and was not able to contribute to the project or even
    dedicate himself to much to studying. We devote all of the time and work spent in this project to him; hoping for better times soon.

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Navigating the source</h2>
    The Enigma source code is composed of multiple parts:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>a common core</h3>
        <code>teams-game/common/</code><br>
        Code that we don't have to write again if we want to support a new platform,
        but just use it as a library.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>platform specific view code</h3>
        <code>teams-game/android-app/</code><br>
        The real Android application that can be run on any Android 4.4 device or newer.<br>
        Start looking at MainActivity or EnigmaApplication to get started.
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>game levels</h3>
        <code>teams-game/levels/</code><br>
        Game levels are template directives or HTML content, ready to be
        packaged by our own tool, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/fdi2-epsilon/equests-gradle">equests-gradle</a>, in eqc files ready to be loaded in the app.
      </li>
    </ul>

  </div>

  <div class="slide">
    <h2>Compile n' run</h2>
    Gradle is an highly customizable build tool and we use it to ease our development cycle.<br><br>
    By simply running <code>./gradlew installDebug</code> in the root project directory,
    dependencies are downloaded and the app is compiled and uploaded to a connected Android device or emulator.<br><br>

    If you open the app now, it will show nothing, this is because you need to have some quizzes:
    if you use the emulator, you can package and upload game levels by using <code>./gradlew uploadLevels</code>,
    otherwise you will need to only do <code>./gradlew collectLevels</code> and manually copy generated collections from
    <code>android-app/build/adb-push/</code> to <code>Documents/Enigma/Collections</code> on your phone (create the directories if they do not exist).

    For any problem, <b>TODO</b> please contact us as soon as possible.
